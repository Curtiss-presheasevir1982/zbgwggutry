Okay, so, freshly dragged myself out of iHostage and wow, my back’s in revolt like a colony of disgruntled meerkats. Also, popcorn remnants are sneaking down my t-shirt. How did that happen, I wasn’t even eating the caramel ones? The theater was a zoo, not in the animal planet sense, just loud.

The film, iHostage, or was it iHostilege? Lost somewhere, but vivid — especially that scene where the protagonist, who definitely looked like my third-grade hamster but taller and in that blue jacket. He’s stuck, not emotionally like my cat dealing with the roomba, but stuck in some underground matrix of tunnels or dreams or maybe pipelines? Definitely pipelines. God, my back should give a review too.

> The villain! my brain can’t remember his face cuz his dialogue was like the dull lectures from that ornithology conference last year, all screeching cicadas and owls — but less fun. He had that weird habit, like he was puffing up like a pufferfish with every sneer.

Half the time, the hero acted like he was trying to decode my mom’s soup recipes — all puzzled, eyebrows dancing the cha-cha. And the sound editing! Good grief, a chimpanzee with cymbals in my ears every time the action dialed up. Download the movie if you’ve got noise-canceling headphones, honestly. Or just, watch the movie for those eerily relatable multitasking fails the character went through — like me juggling umbrella genetics and that elusive gym schedule.

They crammed in all these animal motifs, like everything was symbolic? Weird for a tech thriller, to suddenly become a safari. But maybe brilliant? Or maybe it's just my zoologist goggles seeing metaphors where pixels live. Can’t say for certain.

Right, someone passes by with perfume that smells oddly like the skunk trails on a foggy morning hike. Brain shifts back to the screen…the ending, oh right, the conclusion was like entwined DNA strands…headed somewhere profound but twisted all the way there. You know? Leaving the door ajar for part two, or maybe leaving us hanging like a bat upside down.
